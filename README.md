## Overview
### Description
**Meal Buddy** is a web application that allows users to maintain a feed explicitly for food recipes via Firebase. It allows users to create their own recipes ... [TODO]

- **Category:** Food, Entertainment
- **Mobile:** This app would be originally developed on the web, much like other recipe web applications (CookBook, [TODO] etc)
- **Story:** Food is a large part of human life. Our app will allow people to easily create, view, and track the calories of the food they eat daily. 
- **Market:** Anyone with a Google account can be the user of this app. Ability to create and view various recipes allows the users to organize and prepare their foods.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often as the user would like, depending on when they want to use recipes ... [TODO]
- **Scope:** First we started with building the CRUD features to allow the users to interact with their own recipes on My Recipes page ... [TODO]
