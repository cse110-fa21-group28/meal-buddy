# Public directory
## This is the directory that includes all logics of the web app:
- [index.html](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-buddy/blob/CD-13Farnia/public/index.html) is the entry point of this project
- [assets](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-buddy/tree/CD-13Farnia/public/assets) stores all the asset files (css, images...)
- [backend](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-buddy/tree/CD-13Farnia/public/backend) includes functions that interacts with firebase database
- [src](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-buddy/tree/CD-13Farnia/public/src) is where all the frontend is implemented.
Because some of technical problem, most of the functions in `backend` are deprecated. So we only use `backend` as a helper, which technically make `src` is the true source of the app.
